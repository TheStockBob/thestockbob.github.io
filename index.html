Swing ideas: <p>
</p>
FAZE - Merger vote on February 27th.  .20 is guarenteed.  It will be .1301 of GAME, which at 1.55 is .20.  Load sub .20 if at all possible, expect a spike to .28 minimum, preferably .50. <p>
WAVD - Merger agreement vote on March 14th 10 AM.  Load preferably sub $2s until then.  Expect a spike above $3 possibly $5.  Compare to November spike.<p></p>
<s></s></sd>ALCE - low despac, if it gets below .20 load heavily.  Otherwise play momentum, expect a pop.</s> ran .3 -> .4955 2/23 <p></p> 
STI - same as ALCE.<p></p>
Possible STI / ALCE comparisons will be EGOX / SVMH / AAGR, could fit any of these patterns.<p></p>


TLDR: slap 3:55 patents.  66% success rate (technically higher) into AH.  Be ready to unload at 4:03 if necessary.  Never swing into 4 am.  Good ones rarely may bounce at 7 am.
