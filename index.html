Swing ideas: <p>
</p>
FAZE - Merger vote on February 27th.  .20 is guarenteed.  Load sub .20 if at all possible, expect a spike to .28 minimum, preferably .50.

WAVD - Merger agreement vote on March 14th 10 AM.  Load preferably sub $2s until then.  Expect a spike above $3 possibly $5.  Compare to November spike.<p></p>

ALCE - low despac, if it gets below .20 load heavily.  Otherwise play momentum, expect a pop.<p></p>
STI - same as ALCE.<p></p>
